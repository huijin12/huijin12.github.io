excerpt: 'We propose a buffer mechanism and found evidence that supports such mechanism being em- ployed by language models during the reasoning process in symbolic multi-step reasoning tasks and provide a detailed analysis of the model’s internal thinking process for vertical and horizontal thinking from the perspective of the buffer. We propose a method to enhance the model’s reasoning capability, significantly improving data utilization efficiency in logical reasoning datasets.'
